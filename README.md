Footy-Finder is an app which was created with the M.E.R.N. stack as well as Create-React-App & React-Router-Dom. Users can view, update and create their own favorite parks to play soccer in.

It should be noted that I switched repo's at about the 1 week point of the project due to getting merge conflicts which is why commits on the footy-finder repo only date back to this point. There is another repo within my github with the same name(and no dash) that has commits for the first half of the allotted project time(the first few days were spent researching and getting set up and i was also unfortunately sick at this time so admittedly the commits are more frequent as the project proceeded)

Another note re: my portfolio site, for the unit 4 project we had issues with heroku and presented locally as per Leland so i was unable to provide a live link to the deployed version.
